# INT-UEBUNGEN

Welcome to the INT-UEBUNGEN Repository! This is a space where I share my solutions to coding assignments from our school. The solutions are provided here to inspire and assist you, but remember that the true essence of learning lies in understanding and applying the concepts.

Feel free to explore the codebase for insights, guidance, and inspiration for your own coding assignments. It's important not to copy the code directly, as that undermines the learning experience. Instead, use these solutions to learn, adapt, and enhance your coding skills.
